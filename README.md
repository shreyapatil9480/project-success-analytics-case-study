# Project Success Analytics Case Study

Where are resources overallocated?

**Stakeholder:** Resource Manager

## Key Insights

- Bench time under 4 hours/week signals overallocation risk.
- Billable hours above 42/week precedes overallocation flags.
- FTE above 1.2 on a single initiative raises overload probability.
